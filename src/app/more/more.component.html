<h1 class="cover-heading">Who am I</h1>
<p class="lead">I started learning programming in 2014. The first language I learned is C. I stepped into object oriented programming with C# and reinforced it with Java. I focused on .Net and Spring technologies. Later I learned JavaScript, React and Angular. I developed this page with Angular.</p>
